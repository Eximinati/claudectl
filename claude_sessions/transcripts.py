"""The one reader for Claude Code's .jsonl transcripts.

Eight modules used to open these files themselves, and four of them called
`readlines()` — which materialises the whole file. A single project directory
here holds transcripts past 100 MB, and `/api/dashboard` polls every 10 s, so
that pattern is both the memory ceiling and the latency floor of the app.

Everything streams. One decoding policy (`errors='replace'` — a transcript is
user data and must never raise), one timestamp parser, and a `prefilter`
substring test applied to the raw line so the common case (a caller that wants
only the lines mentioning `"Bash"` or `file_path`) never pays for a
`json.loads` it is going to discard.
